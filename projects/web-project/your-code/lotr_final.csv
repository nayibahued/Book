The Ring remains hidden.And that we should seek to destroy it......has not yet enteredtheir darkest dreams. And so the weapon of the enemyis moving towards Mordor......in the hands of a Hobbit.Each day brings it closerto the fires of Mount Doom.

SARUMAN,"So you have come here for information. I have some for you.    ,Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the great eye has seen it! Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon.     ,     You are all going to die! But you know this don't you Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows will never be crowned King. ,Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him' those he professes to love! Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death.",The Return of the King,5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5d,201,11,11,2003,700,8.9,94,Gandalf and Aragorn lead the World of Men against Sauron's army to draw his gaze from Frodo and Sam as they approach Mount Doom with the One Ring.
GANDALF,"They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one     day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once     was before it fell into decay. ,     The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more     splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their     descent , dearer than the names of their sons.    ,     Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers     asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.    ,     The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was     given over to lesser men.",The Return of the King,5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5d,201,11,11,2003,669,8.9,94,Gandalf and Aragorn lead the World of Men against Sauron's army to draw his gaze from Frodo and Sam as they approach Mount Doom with the One Ring.
BILBO,"Frodo, someone at     the door. ,In fact, it     has been remarked by some that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.    , A rather unfair observation    , As     we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales    ,and the smoking of pipeweed. , But where     our hearts truly lie , is in peace and quiet ,and good     tilled earth. ,For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow.    ,And yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint    , But today of all days, it is brought home to me it is     no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.",The Fellowship of the Ring,5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5c,178,13,4,2001,561,8.8,92,A meek Hobbit from the Shire and eight companions set out on a journey to destroy the powerful One Ring and save Middle-earth from the Dark Lord Sauron.
LEGOLAS,"One that is cursed. Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to     the last King of Gondor , to come to his aid, to fight. But when     the time came, when Gondor's need was dire, they fled vanishing into the     darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until     they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight,     the forgotten people? The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the     North shall he come, need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the     Paths of the Dead.",The Return of the King,5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5d,201,11,11,2003,555,8.9,94,Gandalf and Aragorn lead the World of Men against Sauron's army to draw his gaze from Frodo and Sam as they approach Mount Doom with the One Ring.
DENETHOR,"You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have     not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen     more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against     Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides     with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son     of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the     North.

GALADRIEL,"The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For     five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave     it waited. ,     Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumour grew of a shadow     in the East, whispers of a nameless fear. , And     the Ring of Power perceived. ,     Its time had now come. , It abandoned Gollum.    , But something happened then     that the Ring did not intend, it was picked up by the most unlikely creature     imaginable.",The Fellowship of the Ring,5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5c,178,13,4,2001,493,8.8,92,A meek Hobbit from the Shire and eight companions set out on a journey to destroy the powerful One Ring and save Middle-earth from the Dark Lord Sauron.
GANDALF,"His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.    , He knows the Heir of     Elendil has come forth ,     Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough,     perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples     of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. , He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground    , before he     sees a King return to the throne of men.

BILBO,"I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I     think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the     fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but     I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. , I feel     thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a     holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return.

BILBO,"So there I was at the mercy of three monstrous trolls and     they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook     us. Whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by     one and squash us into jelly. ,They     spent so much time arguing the witherto's and whyfor's that the sun's first     light cracked open over the top of the trees.

STRIDER,"They were once men. Great Kings of Men. The Sauron     the Deciever gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed     they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness    ,Now they are slaves to his will. They are     the Nazg'l. Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

GALADRIEL,"For within these rings was bound the strength and will     to govern each race. ,     But they were all of them deceived. ,For another ring was made. , In the land of Mordor, ,in the fires of Mount Doom (, the dark Lord Sauron forged in     secret a master Ring ,to control all others and into this Ring he poured     all his cruelty, his malice , and his will to     dominate all life. , One Ring to rule them all.",The Fellowship of the Ring,5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5c,178,13,4,2001,415,8.8,92,A meek Hobbit from the Shire and eight companions set out on a journey to destroy the powerful One Ring and save Middle-earth from the Dark Lord Sauron.
ARAGORN,"Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers. (They listen to him.) I see it in     your eyes, the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come     when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all     bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day!

GANDALF,"Pity ? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.     Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give     it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even     the very wise cannot see all ends.

DENETHOR,"It's dangerous,     I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But     you, you are strong.    And our need is great. It is our blood which is being spilled, our people     who are dying. Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies. He will     return. And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.

SAM,"I know. It's all wrong.      ,By rights, we shouldn't even be here.      But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

GANDALF,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for     them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that     is given to us.
