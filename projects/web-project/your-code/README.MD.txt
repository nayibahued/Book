This document describes the steps followed in the project.
The first thing to do is import the libraries that are going to be used in the file, then we import the CVS and the API with the correspondent token. 
Then with these two data frames, we can make the merge and define the length of the dialogues, the resulting data frame is sorted by the maximum length, so we can visualize the longest lines in the movies.
The WEB-SCRAPE adds the ranking and the description of the movies from the imbd site, after that another merge takes place to get our final data frame, but it won't be imoported yet, because there's a character cleaning left.
Finally, we can see the insights and results of the data analysis.
